          <h1>Havven<br>Design Proposal</h1>
          <h2>Audit of the existing Havven site, as well as the work Ustwo delivered</h2>
          <p>Ustwo have provided a great foundation to move the design and brand of Havven forward, but I believe there is still a lot more attention required to help Havven reach it’s full potential. The proto-brand process that Ustwo has employed is a great process that I generally utilise with in my own personal process—but I believe there is definitely some room to push it further. </p>
          <p>They’ve made some great recommendations which I generally agree with, but as we move forward I will be aiming to use their work as a foundation to build on top of, and will continue defining and refreshing the Havven design as we push forward.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>What I beleive I can bring to Havven</h2>
          <p>By working as an individual, compared to a much larger agency—I believe I can get finalised design work to production in a quicker fashion, whilst still maintaining a high level of craft. Having a lot of previous experience in the crypto/blockchain industry, I believe we’ll be able to move faster as I understand a lot of the basics of cryptocurrency and designing decentralised applications. As an investor in the Havven ICO I am also financially incentivised to do my best work and see Havven grow.</p>

          <h2>Suggestions on how to move forward</h2>
          <p>After reviewing all of the work that has been completed so far, and after getting a sense of what is needed on your end, I believe it will be best for the both of us to split the workload out into ‘sprints’. These sprints can we spread out in a weekly or fortnightly fashion depending on the workload, and we can collaboratively decide and define what tasks will require focus for each sprint.</p>
          <p>By using a more flexible approach like this, we can scale our focus up or down depending on your needs and we can adjust and refine our focus as we move forward, depending on what is uncovered during each sprint.</p>

        <section id="roadmap">
          <h2 class="bigger fadein">Suggested Roadmap<br>and Estimations</h2>
          <p class="fadein">I’m open to hearing your consideration, but here is a suggested roadmap for how I personally believe we could move forward. Everything outlined in the roadmap is open for discussion, the suggested timings are just estimates used to give you a sense of how much costs could be involved.</p>

          <div class="sprint fadein">
            <h2>Sprint 1 – Continuing Brand Refresh and Web</h2>
            <small>3.0 – 5.0 Days</small>
            <ul>
              <li>A quick look into refreshing the Havven Brand including (Logotype, Typefaces, Colour Scheme, Image Treatment, Layout Styles etc)</li>
              <li>Showcasing these brand explorations across a few key web screens e.g Home Page, Balance Checker, How it Works etc.</li>
              <li>A few  days for Feedback/Refinements</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The aim of this sprint is to push the work that Ustwo have done a little further and allows me to address the current issues you see with the work they’ve completed, and to add in my own suggestions. </p>
            <p>I understand re-investing time into the brand may be seen as a waste of money/time/effort that could be better spent on more pressing tasks, but this stage is important as it allows us to break down any constraints and issues that may hold the project back.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="sprint fadein">
            <h2>Sprint 2 – Finalizing Web Design</h2>
            <small>10.0 – 14.0 Days</small>
            <p>From the first sprint, we should have a solid foundation to move forward with and we should be both be happy and ready to move forward with rolling everything out across your various touchpoints.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Finalise the design of the Main Website</li>
              <li>Design the Balance Checker</li>
              <li>Design the Alchemy Dashboard</li>
              <li>Responsive Designs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A lot of the work for these sections have been done, so its mainly just a matter of improving them and refreshing them with the updated brand style. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="sprint fadein">
            <h2>Sprint 3 – Brand Asset Production</h2>
            <small>3.0 – 6.0 Days</small>
            <p>With the brand updated and the web components complete, we should take a sprint to finish up any odds and ends that need completing.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Social Media Images</li>
              <li>Coin/General Icons</li>
              <li>Presentation Templates</li>
              <li>Print Items</li>
              <li>Blog Post Templates</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="sprint fadein">
            <h2>Sprint 4 – Landing Page Templates</h2>
            <small>3.0 – 6.0 Days</small>
            <p>A sprint dedicated to designing landing page templates, either utlising Unbounce, Instapage or writing it in raw HTML/CSS.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Competition Template</li>
              <li>Hackathon Template</li>
              <li>Announcement Template</li>
              <li>Product Download Template</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

        <section class="fadein" id="pricing">
          <h2 class="bigger">Pricing and Availability</h2>
          <p>I work on a time and materials basis, at a day rate (usually around 8.0 Hours) of <em>$880/day inclusive of 10% GST.</em></p>
          <p>Day to day, I work from a co-working in space in Surry Hills and I am more than happy to come to your office for regular catchups or workshop sessions. The time spent within these meetings will be included in each sprint.</p>
          <p>I currently work with a revolving roster of cryptocurrency clients, and will continue working other projects during my engagement with Havven. I believe this creates a great situation as it allows me to scale focus up or down across clients, and adjust focus according to each clients quickly changing needs. Because of this, I may not be able to give Havven a full time focus, but I will always be able to guarantee a dedication of at least 2 days/week. If at anytime you need to scale up or down, please give me a bit of notice and I can try my best to make sure all your needs are met appropriately.</p>
          <p>In terms of billing, I will send a tax invoice at the end of each sprint – or on a fortnightly basis if a sprint lasts for more than 2 weeks. Each invoice will require payment within at least 14 business days of issuance.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="fadein">
          <h2 class="bigger">Next Steps</h2>
          <p>If you’re ready to move forward, please let me know as soon as possible and we can get things rolling. Prior to commencing work I’ll need you to sign a brief contractors agreement — to make sure we are both protected legally. Once that is signed I suggest we organise some time for a kickoff meeting, where we can collaboratively work on a roadmap to move forward with.</p>
